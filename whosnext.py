"""Script to make a weighted random selection for the next lab meeting
presenter.

How to use:

    1. Update the MC.
    2. Update the list of current members.
    3. Add the most recent presentations to presentation.json (mind the name spelling).
    4. Run ``python whosnext.py``

Dependencies:

    - python >= 3
    - pyfiglet

Either ``pip install pyfiglet`` or ``conda install -c conda-forge pyfiglet``
